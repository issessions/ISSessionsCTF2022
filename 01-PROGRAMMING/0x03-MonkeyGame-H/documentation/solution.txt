Use SOCKET or PWNTOOLS to connect to the nc, then read the input. It could be put into eval and completed or you can iterate through and use a script such as seen in the solution.py.
If you encounter a +, add the 2 numbers, a -, subtract the 2 numbers.

Return the reslt

Do this 500 times and get the flag

SOLUTION SCRIPT

split = test.split(" ")
sumTotal = int(split[0])
for x in range (1,len(split)-1,2):
	print(split[x])
	operator = split[x]
	number = int(split[x+1])
	if(operator =='+'):
		sumTotal+= number
	else:
		sumTotal -=number

print(sumTotal)
