"How you do that!!!" the monkey screams at you, upset at your ability to beat his apparently very thought out game.

After he begrudgingly hands you a smushed, small banana he looks you in the eye.

"Now you have to try level 2!! NO WAY YOU CAN BEAT THIS ONE. DOUBLE OR NOTHING"

While you're not even sure if you want to win another one of these poor banana's you may as well try to humour him.
