The first step is to determine the lowest and highest values in the list, as they are always guaranteed to be missing.
Subtract them to determine the range

Afterwards, there are many ways, one being to create a list of the values that should exist and then
compare it against the list read from the program. Any value not in your list is missing, and can therefore
be concatenated into a string and sent back.
