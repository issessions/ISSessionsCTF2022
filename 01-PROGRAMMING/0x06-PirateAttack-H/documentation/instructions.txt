A fleet of cyborg pirates threaten the monkey's fishing business! If they are not stopped, they will strip the shore clean of all the fishes and their habitat, making it impossible to feed their people. Unfortunately, the monkeys only have one cannonball for each ship and the pirates are extremely fast. Are you able to program a machine capable of identifying the ships on time and dispatching them with no error?
