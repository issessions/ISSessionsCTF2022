1. Make the script network with the host

2. Send the correct setting based on the instruction

3. Format the message line-by-line

4. Either reconstruct it into a 2D array based on length of characters or incrementally read each line

5. If the unicode character is detected for pirates, state the position on the grid

6. Send the completed array

7. Loop until flag is done
