description: A fleet of cyborg pirates threaten the monkey's fishing business! If
  they are not stopped, they will strip the shore clean of all the fishes and their
  habitat, making it impossible to feed their people. Unfortunately, the monkeys only
  have one cannonball for each ship and the pirates are extremely fast. Are you able
  to program a machine capable of identifying the ships on time and dispatching them
  with no error?
