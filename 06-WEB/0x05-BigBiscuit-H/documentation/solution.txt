Right-click and select Inspect

Navigate to the cookies section and notice that there is a cookie called "user"

After base64 decoding the value of that cookie, you'll get {name: "normal_user", cool: "False"}

Replace the values and make it look like {name: "supercookie", cool: "True"} and then base64 encode it again

e25hbWU6ICJzdXBlcmNvb2tpZSIsIGNvb2w6ICJUcnVlIn0=

Replace the base64 encode value of user with e25hbWU6ICJzdXBlcmNvb2tpZSIsIGNvb2w6ICJUcnVlIn0= and then refresh the web page.
