SQL injection

There is a second order SQL injection in the print name function.

The login screen and registration screen are both safe, however the registration screen allows you to create a username that contains SQL syntax.

The query after log in where it checks to see the first name of the user is vulnerable, as the app assumes values it grabs from the databse are safe.

A malicious user can create an account with the following injection: ' UNION select password from users where username = 'admin' order by password desc--

They would then have to login with this account, where the injection will finally be executed by the unsafe backend query, printing out the password of the admin user.
