SQL injection

The injection is in the registration form. 

By inspecting the db.sql file, players will notice there is a privilege column.

While you cannot manually submit a privilege level in an account registration, the form itself is vulnerable to SQLi

This means through what we assume the query to look like on the backend, if we inject some thing like:

monkey', 'password',2)-- 

into the username field, it will create an account called monkey, password of password, and privilege level of 2. Log in using the info to get the flag.
