description: On this challenge, there is an executable binary located in /usr/bin
  named gottagofast<br><br>You can execute it from anywhere in connection, by simply
  typing gottagofast into terminal.<br><br>There is a flag file located in the root
  folder, however you do not have permission to read it as a normal user.<br>This
  is a binary exploitation challenge, you will have to exploit the gottagofast binary
  to have it read the flag for you somehow.<br><br>You do not have to perform linux
  privilege escalation in any way.<br><br>This is a war-game style challenge, meaning
  all players will be on the same SSH connection, so be careful when creating files!
  Cover your tracks! Other users CAN read your files.<br><br>Good lucK!!!
