description: Upon walking into the market square, you notice a dimly lit shop with
  a brightly coloured sign reading:<br>"Red Banana! Green Banana! Orange Banana...
  and THE banana!"<br>Confused, you enter the establishment to be greeted by noone
  save for a self-serve kiosk. Hopefully they have good stuff?

- content: Notice that 2 of the options have restrictions on what you can enter while
    a third one does not... Lower restriction input is always a good place to start.
