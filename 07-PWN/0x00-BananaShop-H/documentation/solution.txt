The orange banana function has no restrictions on input, therefore allowing an integer overflow if you enter a huge number such as 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Because we multiply 900 by the input, it ends up thinking the total cost is 900 * -1, so when you subtract -900 from your balance of 1000 you're left with a +900 balance to your account. 
Do this twice and you will have enough to buy THE banana, printing the flag.
