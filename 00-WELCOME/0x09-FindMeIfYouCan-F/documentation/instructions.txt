We've obtained a cryptic hard drive with a suspicious file. However, there are way too many directories for us to manually search! All what we know is that the file is named "FLAG.txt". Are you able to get the file for us?

NOTE: You'll need to manually add "monkeyCTF{*flag here*}" to your submission!
