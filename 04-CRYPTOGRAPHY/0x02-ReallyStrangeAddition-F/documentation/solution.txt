CHALLENGE SOLUTION:
-------------------
There are two functions you need to understand to be able to reverse the encryption: doa() and dob().
If you read through doa(), it simply goes through every byte in the file and performs a bit rotation.
For dob(), you might be able to recognize that it's performing an RSA encryption based on a few clues, one of the biggest ones being:
 - That the innermost while loop is performing Fast Modular Exponentiation
Once you understand these two parts, you can reuse the provided script to decrypt the flag.txt file:
- Figure out the RSA decryption key by factorizing n in dob() (decryption key = 3450419)
- Altering the bit rotation in doa() to rotate the opposite direction
Afterwards, by reversing the order of execution of the encryption and encodings, it will be possible to recreate the original file
