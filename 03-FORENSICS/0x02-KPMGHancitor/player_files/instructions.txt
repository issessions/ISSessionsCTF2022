A new client has reported Hancitor in their network, and you, a member of the KPMG incident response team, have been tasked with identifying the initial breach vector. Conduct a packet capture analysis to identify and extract the breach vector into a safe location, and then provide the client with an MD5 hash of the file to add to their file exclusion blacklist. 
To generate a hash of this file, try using CyberChef: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=MD5() 
Note: This packet capture contains traffic from a real Hancitor session. When handling forensic objects, especially concerning malware, you should always work in an isolated and safe environment such as a virtual machine. Even though the sample is not live, you should still treat the extracted objects with care and avoid modifying the filetype of extracted artefacts. 
The flag format is MonkeyCTF{md5hashgoeshere}
