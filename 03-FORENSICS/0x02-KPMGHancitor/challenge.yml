description: 'A new client has reported Hancitor in their network, and you, a member
  of the KPMG incident response team, have been tasked with identifying the initial
  breach vector. Conduct a packet capture analysis to identify and extract the breach
  vector into a safe location, and then provide the client with an MD5 hash of the
  file to add to their file exclusion blacklist. <br>To generate a hash of this file,
  try using CyberChef: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=MD5() <br>Note: This
  packet capture contains traffic from a real Hancitor session. When handling forensic
  objects, especially concerning malware, you should always work in an isolated and
  safe environment such as a virtual machine. Even though the sample is not live,
  you should still treat the extracted objects with care and avoid modifying the filetype
  of extracted artefacts. <br>The flag format is MonkeyCTF{md5hashgoeshere}'
