The monkeys have been using a new automated prison system to keep members of a dangerous organization locked up.
However, a recent site inspection has led to the discovery of 3 members escaping: Koba, Thade and Zaius. Due to the lack of physical damage, it is believed the prison system was hacked.
Are you able to investigate the prison door logs for anomalies to help us pinpoint when each prisoner escaped?
