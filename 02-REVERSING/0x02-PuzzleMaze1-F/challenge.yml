hints:
- content: CHALLENGE HINT:<br>---------------<br>The "v4" variable seems to be a very
    long array at first glance, but the command() function only ever changes its referencing
    index, the "v3" in 1, 2, 10, or 20 increments.<br>Maybe the "v4" variable can
    also be represented as a 2D array to help you visualize the solution...<br>
