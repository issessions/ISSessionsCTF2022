CHALLENGE HINT:
---------------
The "v4" variable seems to be a very long array at first glance, but the command() function only ever changes its referencing index, the "v3" in 1, 2, 10, or 20 increments.
Maybe the "v4" variable can also be represented as a 2D array to help you visualize the solution...
