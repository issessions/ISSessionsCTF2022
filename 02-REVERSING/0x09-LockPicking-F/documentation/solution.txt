Looking at the code, the program applies simple operations to the variable [pick] based on user input.

Success is based on checking if all 32 bits of [pick] is set to 1.

In order to have the shortest solution, the goal is to use the operations to make [pick] = 138840.
	Afterwards, by applying the 1 operation: [pick] = 138840 - 138841 = -1.
	This operation causes an integer underflow, setting all bits of [pick] to 1.
Operations:
	Start: [pick] = 0
	2: [pick] = 0 + 5 = 5
	7: [pick] = 5 * 11 = 55
	4: [pick] = 55 + 61 = 116
	6: [pick] = 116 * 7 = 812
	4: [pick] = 812 + 61 = 873
	8: [pick] = 873 * 53 = 46269
	3: [pick] = 46269 + 11 = 46280
	5: [pick] = 46280 * 3 = 138840 # One step away
	1: [pick] = 138840 - 138841 = -1
	E: Desired value is set, end session.
