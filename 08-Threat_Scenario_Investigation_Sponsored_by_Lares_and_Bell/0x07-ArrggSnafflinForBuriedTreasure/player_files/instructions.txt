Question #07:
------------

The attacker also searches for credentials in SMB shares. Based on a file retrieved from the compromised machine (attached), they appear to be using a tool called Snaffler (https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) to "snaffle" credentials. What is the username and the password of the second account they compromise (after monkeydluffy)? In what file does the attacker find these credentials?

ANSWER FORMAT: monkeyCTF{Username:Password:FilenameWithExtension} (All lowercase. Username should not include domain name. Filename ONLY, not full path.)
EXAMPLE ANSWER: monkeyCTF{masterroshi:i<3goku:bulmas_passwords.docx}
