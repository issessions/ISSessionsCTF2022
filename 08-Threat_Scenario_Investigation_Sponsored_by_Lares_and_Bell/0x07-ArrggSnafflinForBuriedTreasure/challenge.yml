description: 'Question #07:<br>------------<br><br>The attacker also searches for
  credentials in SMB shares. Based on a file retrieved from the compromised machine
  (attached), they appear to be using a tool called Snaffler (https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler)
  to "snaffle" credentials. What is the username and the password of the second account
  they compromise (after monkeydluffy)? In what file does the attacker find these
  credentials?<br><br>ANSWER FORMAT: monkeyCTF{Username:Password:FilenameWithExtension}
