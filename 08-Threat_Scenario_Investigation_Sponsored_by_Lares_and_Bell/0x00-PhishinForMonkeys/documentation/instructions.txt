Luffy, of the notorious Straw Hat pirates, reported strange "popups" on his laptop after downloading and executing a file sent to him by someone claiming to be Roronoa Zoro, a longtime friend and rival who now works in IT after many successful years as a pirate swordsman, asking him to update his BananaVPN client. Upon further investigation, it was determined that an attacker may have stolen Monkey Island's Active Directory database. Your task is to piece together what happened and report the information to Monkey Island security.
