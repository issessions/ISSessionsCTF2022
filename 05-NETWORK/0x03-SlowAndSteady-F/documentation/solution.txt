===Solution 1===
1. Find and isolate the suspicious traffic [192.168.85.128] (I used the filter ip.addr==192.168.85.128 && frame.len > 100)
2. Select all and export packet dissection to desired file type (I used JSON)
3. Carve the hex data from the tcp payload of each packet (I made a quick script to do this)
4. Convert from Hex x2 and save as PDF
5. Open PDF and copy flag on front page
